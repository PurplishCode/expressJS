// Dynamic Route!

// We mostly define our route with fixed or static. But how about giving the parameters into the URL, which will automatically sent res based on its parameters?
// Well! Using req parameters is possible.


const express = require('express'); // Taking the express module then initialized it into our express variable.


const app = express(); // app will hold the express() value.

const PORT = 3000; // The PORT our server would listen to.


// You can use the req.params object to access all the parameters you pass in the url.. (Don't forget to use ":" to pass in your parameters.)
app.get('/:id', (req,res) => {
    res.send("Hello! " + req.params.id)
})



app.listen(PORT)


// COOL-TIPS:  Express matches routes from start to end of the index.js file, including the external routers you required.
